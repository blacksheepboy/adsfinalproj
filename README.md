My repo for the final project for Advanced Data Science at JHSPH 1st Term 2017

Inital Proposal:

Option 6 - Project Petition

Question: Is there a correlation between the safer sex practices employed in gay porn videos viewed on popular pornographic websites in the United States in the last 5 - 10 years and:
  1. PrEP's US timeline (approval of Truvada as for pre-exposure prophylaxis, news cycle and ad campaigns, major health department efforts, cultural mentions, etc.) ,
  2. Rates of gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia among MSM in the USA,
  3. Timeline of gay male social apps (Grindr, Scruff, etc.)?
